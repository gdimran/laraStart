            <p>Preparing income tax return by yourself can be a task that leaves you with more questions than answers. According to a study, most taxpayers believe they benefited from using professional tax advisors.</p>
            <p>Today's tax laws and regulation are so complicated that filing a relatively simple return can be confusing. It is just too easy to overlook deductions and credits to which you are entitled. Even if you use a computer software program there's no substitute for the assistance of an experienced tax advisor.</p>
            <p><b>Here's what your get...</b></p>
            <p></p><ul>
              <li>Your income tax return will be checked and rechecked by our computer software identifying potential problems the NBR may look at more closely for the purpose of audit.</li>
              <li>Our staff will assess your income tax return as per existing laws and rules and identify any missing credit/rebate applicable to the assesse in order to reduce tax liabilities.</li>
              <li>Book keeping difficult: No Problem!
              If you have a small business and haven't kept up your bookkeeping, don't worry. We can help you. We'll prepare your bookkeeping for the year, prepare a full Schedule, as well as your personal income tax return. Then we'll help you set up an easy system that allows you to keep your books in tip-top shape next year.</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <br>
            <p></p><h3>Tax Planning</h3><p></p>
            <p>Planning is the vital to successfully and legally reducing your tax burden. We go beyond tax compliance and proactively recommend tax saving strategies to minimize tax and maximize your tax-free wealth.</p>
            <p>We always try to enrich our mastery of the current tax law, complex tax rule, and new tax regulations by attending various local and international tax seminars.</p>
            <p>Company and individuals pay the lowest amount of taxes allowable by law because we continually look for ways to minimize your taxes throughout the year, not just at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>We recommend <b>Tax Saving Strategies</b> that help you...</p>
            <p></p><ul>

            </ul><p></p>

            <p></p><ul>
              <li>Splitting income among several family members or legal entities in order to get more of the income taxed in lower bracket.</li>
              <li>Shifting income or expenses from one year to another in order to have them fall where it will be taxed at a lower rate.</li>
              <li>Deferring tax liabilities through certain investment choices such as pension plans, contributions and other similar plans.</li>
              <li>Finding tax deductions by structuring your money to pay for things you enjoy, such as a vacation home.</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <p>Please do keep in mind; we are at your service not for the NBR. Many of our clients save many times the fee reduced tax liability and avoiding certain taxes through careful planning and appropriate tax strategies.</p>
